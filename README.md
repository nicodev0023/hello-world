# hello-world
Hi!
Nico here. This is my 1st time using Github. I like developing apps and websites. 
Preferred programming languages: C, C++, C#, Python, ASM
Preferred webdev/markup languages: HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript, ASP
Currently learning: Java, Ruby on Rails, Python 3, PHP7, WebAssembly, etc.

My dream is to learn and master new and existing languages to do things possible. Thanks.
